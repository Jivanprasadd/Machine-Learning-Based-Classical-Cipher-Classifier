# Machine Learning Based Classical Cipher Classifier

## Overview

<p style="text-align: justify;">This project aims to build a machine learning-based classifier to distinguish between various classical ciphers. Classical ciphers are historical encryption techniques that perform simple substitution or transposition on plaintext to produce ciphertext. By training a machine learning model on labeled examples of ciphertexts from different ciphers, the classifier can predict the cipher used to encrypt an unseen ciphertext.</p>

## Classical Ciphers

### Group 1: Substitution Ciphers

#### 1. Playfair Cipher

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Playfair Cipher, invented by Charles Wheatstone in 1854, was favored by diplomats and military leaders for its security and ease of use. It was used extensively during World War I and World War II.</p>

#### 2. Polybius Square Cipher

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Polybius Square Cipher is named after the ancient Greek historian and scholar Polybius. It was used by the ancient Greeks and Romans for secret communication.</p>

#### 3. Baconian Cipher

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Baconian Cipher is attributed to Sir Francis Bacon, an English philosopher and statesman. It is rumored that he used this cipher to conceal his works.</p>

#### 4. Atbash Cipher

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Atbash Cipher has its roots in the Hebrew alphabet and is one of the oldest known ciphers. It was used in the Dead Sea Scrolls and is often referred to as the "mirror cipher."</p>

### Group 2: Transposition Ciphers

#### 5. Columnar Transposition Cipher

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Columnar Transposition Cipher gained popularity during the American Civil War. It was used by both the Union and Confederate forces to encrypt military communications.</p>

#### 6. Scytale Cipher

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Scytale Cipher was used by the ancient Greeks and Spartans. The word "scytale" comes from the Greek word "skytalon," which means "baton" or "rod."</p>

#### 7. Rail Fence Cipher

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Rail Fence Cipher is one of the simplest transposition ciphers and was used by Julius Caesar to communicate with his generals.</p>

#### 8. Caesar Cipher

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Caesar Cipher is named after Julius Caesar, who used it for private correspondence. It is considered one of the earliest and simplest encryption techniques.</p>

### Group 3: Advanced Ciphers

#### 9. Hill Cipher

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Hill Cipher was invented by Lester S. Hill in 1929 and is one of the first polygraphic ciphers. It offers stronger security compared to monoalphabetic ciphers.</p>

#### 10. Affine Cipher

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Affine Cipher can be traced back to the ancient civilizations of Egypt and Babylonia. It gained popularity during the Renaissance and was used by Julius Caesar.</p>

#### 11. Vigenère Cipher

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Vigenère Cipher is named after Blaise de Vigenère, a French diplomat who described the cipher in the 16th century. It was considered unbreakable for several centuries.</p>

#### 12. Gronsfeld Cipher

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Gronsfeld Cipher is a variant of the Vigenère Cipher and was used during the Renaissance. It was considered a more secure alternative to other historical ciphers.</p>

## Conclusion

<p style="text-align: justify;">By training a machine learning model on labeled datasets containing ciphertexts encrypted with these classical ciphers, we can build a powerful classifier capable of recognizing the encryption technique used in unseen ciphertexts. This classifier can aid in the analysis and decryption of encrypted messages, providing valuable insights into historical encryption methods and their security strengths. Understanding classical ciphers not only helps us appreciate the ingenuity of historical cryptographers but also serves as a foundation for modern cryptographic techniques used in computer security and data protection.</p>
